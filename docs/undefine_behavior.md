* The exception-mask argument for one of the functions that provide access to the floating-point status flags has a nonzero value not obtained by bitwise OR of the floating-point exception macros (7.6.2).
* The ``fesetexceptflag`` function is used to set floating-point status flags that were not specified in the call to the ``fegetexceptflag`` function that provided the value of the corresponding ``fexcept_t`` object (7.6.2.4).
* The argument to ``fesetenv`` or ``feupdateenv`` is neither an object set by a call to ``fegetenv`` or ``feholdexcept``, nor is it an environment macro (7.6.4.3, 7.6.4.4).

* A signal occurs other than as the result of calling the ``abort`` or ``raise`` function, and the signal handler refers to an object with static storage duration other than by assigning a value to an object declared as ``volatile`` ``sig_atomic_t``, or calls any function in the standard library other than the ``abort`` function, the ``_Exit`` function, or the ``signal`` function (for the same signal number) (7.14.1.1).
* The value of ``errno`` is referred to after a signal occurred other than as the result of calling the ``abort`` or ``raise`` function and the corresponding signal handler obtained a ``SIG_ERR`` return from a call to the ``signal`` function (7.14.1.1).
* A signal is generated by an asynchronous signal handler (7.14.1.1).

* A macro definition of ``va_start``, ``va_arg``, ``va_copy``, or ``va_end`` is suppressed in order to access an actual function, or the program defines an external identifier with the name ``va_copy`` or ``va_end`` (7.15.1).
* The ``va_start`` or ``va_copy`` macro is invoked without a corresponding invocation of the ``va_end`` macro in the same function, or vice versa (7.15.1, 7.15.1.2, 7.15.1.3, 7.15.1.4).
* The type parameter to the ``va_arg`` macro is not such that a pointer to an object of that type can be obtained simply by postfixing a ``*`` (7.15.1.1).
* The ``va_arg`` macro is invoked when there is no actual next argument, or with a specified type that is not compatible with the promoted type of the actual next argument, with certain exceptions (7.15.1.1).
* The ``va_copy`` or ``va_start`` macro is called to initialize a ``va_list`` that was previously initialized by either macro without an intervening invocation of the ``va_end`` macro for the same ``va_list`` (7.15.1.2, 7.15.1.4).

* The member designator parameter of an ``offsetof`` macro is an invalid right operand of the ``.`` operator for the *type* parameter, or designates a bit-field (7.17).
* The argument in an instance of one of the integer-constant macros is not a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constant, or it has a value that exceeds the limits for the corresponding type (7.18.4).
* A byte input/output function is applied to a wide-oriented stream, or a wide character input/output function is applied to a byte-oriented stream (7.19.2).
* Use is made of any portion of a file beyond the most recent wide character written to a wide-oriented stream (7.19.2).
* The value of a pointer to a ``FILE`` object is used after the associated file is closed (7.19.3).
* The stream for the ``fflush`` function points to an input stream or to an update stream in which the most recent operation was input (7.19.5.2).
* The string pointed to by the ``mode`` argument in a call to the ``fopen`` function does not exactly match one of the specified character sequences (7.19.5.3).

* The argument corresponding to an ``s`` specifier without an ``l`` qualifier in a call to the ``fwprintf`` function does not point to a valid multibyte character sequence that begins in the initial shift state (7.24.2.11).
* In a call to the ``wcstok`` function, the object pointed to by ``ptr`` does not have the value stored by the previous call for the same wide string (7.24.4.5.7).
* An ``mbstate_t`` object is used inappropriately (7.24.6).  
* The value of an argument of type ``wint_t`` to a wide character classification or case mapping function is neither equal to the value of ``WEOF`` nor representable as a ``wchar_t`` (7.25.1).
* The ``iswctype`` function is called using a different ``LC_CTYPE`` category from the one in effect for the call to the ``wctype`` function that returned the description (7.25.2.2.1).
* The towctrans function is called using a different LC_CTYPE category from the one in effect for the call to the wctrans function that returned the description (7.25.3.2.1).
